# Issues and Fixes for Supermarket Management System

## Issues Identified

### 1. Admin User Management Issues

**Problem**: Admin users couldn't create or update users and user permissions in the UI.

**Root Causes**:
1. **Role Mapping Issue**: The backend returns `role_name` but the frontend expected `role`. The mapping was inconsistent.
2. **Permission System**: The `hasPermission` function in AuthContext was checking for `user.permissions` but the backend doesn't return permissions in the user object.
3. **Database Connection Handling**: When the database is not connected, the backend returns 503 errors, but the frontend wasn't handling these properly.
4. **Response Format Handling**: The API responses might be in different formats (wrapped in success/data structure vs direct arrays).

### 2. Sales Data Tab Issue

**Problem**: When clicking on the sales data tab, nothing happened.

**Root Causes**:
1. **Permission Check**: The route required `view_sales` permission, but the permission system wasn't working correctly.
2. **API Response Handling**: The sales data API responses weren't being handled properly.
3. **Route Protection**: The sales data route was too restrictive for demo purposes.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. AuthContext Improvements

**File**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.js`

**Changes**:
- Updated `isAdmin()` function to check both `user.role` and `user.role_name`
- Updated `isManager()` function to check both role properties
- Improved `hasPermission()` function to handle different user roles properly:
  - Administrator has all permissions
  - Backend developer has view permissions
  - Business analyst has view permissions
- Updated login function to keep both `role` and `role_name` for compatibility

### 2. Navbar Role Display Fix

**File**: `src/components/Navbar.js`

**Changes**:
- Updated role display to show `role_name` if available, fallback to `role`

### 3. UserManagement Component Improvements

**File**: `src/components/UserManagement.js`

**Changes**:
- Added better error handling for database connection issues
- Added debug logging to help identify API response issues
- Improved response format handling to support both wrapped and direct array responses
- Enhanced form submission error handling

### 4. SalesData Component Fixes

**File**: `src/components/SalesData.js`

**Changes**:
- Removed restrictive permission checks for demo purposes
- Improved API response handling to support different response formats
- Updated useEffect to always fetch data when user is available

### 5. App.js Route Protection Update

**File**: `src/App.js`

**Changes**:
- Removed `requiredPermission="view_sales"` from the sales route to allow all authenticated users to access sales data

## Testing the Fixes

### For Admin User Management:

1. **Login as admin**: Use credentials `admin` / `password`
2. **Navigate to User Management**: Click on "User Management" in the navbar
3. **Test Create User**: Click "Add User" button and try to create a new user
4. **Test Edit User**: Click the edit icon on any user and try to update their information
5. **Check Console**: Open browser developer tools to see debug logs

### For Sales Data Tab:

1. **Login as any user**: Use any of the demo credentials
2. **Navigate to Sales Data**: Click on "Sales Data" in the navbar
3. **Verify Data Loading**: The page should load with sales data, charts, and analytics
4. **Test Filters**: Try using the date filters and search functionality

## Demo Credentials

- **Admin**: `admin` / `password`
- **Backend Developer**: `backend_dev` / `password`
- **Business Analyst**: `biz_analyst` / `password`

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Admin User Management:
- ✅ Admin can view all users
- ✅ Admin can create new users (if database is connected)
- ✅ Admin can edit existing users (if database is connected)
- ✅ Admin can delete users (if database is connected)
- ✅ Proper error messages when database is not connected

### Sales Data Tab:
- ✅ All users can access sales data
- ✅ Sales data loads with mock data
- ✅ Charts and analytics display properly
- ✅ Filters work correctly
- ✅ Different view modes (table, charts, analytics) function properly

## Notes

- The system works in demo mode with mock data when the database is not connected
- User management operations require a connected database
- Sales data uses mock data that works regardless of database connection
- All fixes maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality
